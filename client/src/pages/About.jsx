            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I pursued a degree in Computer Science from Howest Brugge, where I gained a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. During my time at school, I immersed myself in various programming languages and frameworks, honing my skills through hands-on projects and internships.</p>
            <p>Sadly enough during one of my internship I had a bad experience, where I lost my interest in coding and development alike because of bad mentorship and business mentality. Which set me back a few years where I spend my time working on a beachbar.</p>
            <p>As I progressed in that career, I took on roles of increasing responsibility, but I still felt the need for tackling complex challenges and embracing emerging technologies. From building scalable web applications with React and Node.js to delving into the intricacies of machine learning with Python and TensorFlow, I kept comming back to try and learn new technical languages.</p>
            <p>Because of that lingering intereset, I finally decided to throw my career in a new way and follow a training at BeCode Gent. Where my interest grew even larger. From learning front end development to learning backend development. Now looking for a job or internship where I can further learn and develop these skills.</p>
            <p>Outside of my professional endeavors, I'm an avid gamer, and since last year, I also grown a passion for climbing. I believe that the best way to grow as a coder is to surround oneself with a supportive community of peers who inspire and challenge each other to reach new heights (literally when climbing).</p>
            <p>Today, I stand as a junior developer with a diverse skill set and a passion for innovation. I'm excited to continue my journey, exploring new technologies, solving complex problems, and making a meaningful impact through code.</p>
